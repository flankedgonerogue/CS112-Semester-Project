# CS112-Semester-Project
This is my 2nd semester project. The project is a data cleanser and analyzer. While the majority of the project is in C++, I have used python for ML to guess gender from names.
The focus for this project was to use OOP effectively to handle large sets of data by making objects and then manipulating them to fill missing fields etc.
